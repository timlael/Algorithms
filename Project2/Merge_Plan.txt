Approach 1
N[large] - sorted
M[small]

Append and merge sort

Approach 2
N[large] - sorted
M[small]

Sort small then merge


Analysis:
N = 1000, 10000, 100000
M = 25, 50, 100
Run 10 times for each combination and average

Script: 
Show merge sort for 100 elements
Show how smaller file is sorted and merged with larger file
